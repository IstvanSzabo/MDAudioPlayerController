I wrote MDAudioPlayerController for use in one of my own apps and realized after I had finally finished it that it could be quite useful (and very time-saving) for others

If you find it helpful, a Paypal donation would be very really appreciated (mattdonnelly [at] me [dot] com)

Support / Contact / Bugs / Features
-----------------------------------

I can't answer any questions about how to use the code, but I'd love to read any emails telling me that you're using it, creating an app with it, or just saying thanks.

If you want to submit a feature request or bug report, feel free to get in touch. Better yet, fork the code and implement the feature/fix yourself, then submit a pull request.

Enjoy using it!
